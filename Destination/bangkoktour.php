            <p>
                Bangkok has attracted millions of visitors annually for decades, offering tourists an incredible
                experience of cultural tradition-meets-modernity. It’s got world-class food, stunning historical
                landmarks, and some of the best hospitality around the globe. it is the largest and most developed city
                in Thailand but manages to maintain its historical architecture and traditions dating back hundreds of
                years. Bangkok, which is for most a jumping-off point for Thailand holidays, is packed with everything
                from excitement and chaos, to freedom, beauty, and adventure. Through the hustle and bustle, gigantic
                skyscrapers, grand palaces and temples, and a world-renowned floating market, Bangkok continues to
                attract millions of travelers from around the world. one sight you won’t see anywhere else other than in
                Southeast Asia. Picture this – anchored on either side of the river, boats stocked to the brim with
                fresh tropical fruit and veggies, coconut juice, and local food which has been lovingly tendered on open
                grills. The best way to go about exploring Bangkok’s floating markets is to hop aboard one of the many
                guided boat tours on offer. The 3 most popular floating markets in Bangkok are Damnoen Saduak, Amphawa,
                and Klong Lat Mayom with Damnoen Saduak being the most popular floating market in the country.

            <p>Khao San Road – home of the backpacker, the nocturnal party fiend, and a chaotic intersection where west
                meets east. Most famous for its revered nightlife scene and carefree atmosphere, this is where 99% of
                all youngsters will find themselves at least once when in Bangkok. It is also an accommodation hotspot
                for many as a great variety of cheap accommodation types can be found within the vicinity of Khao San
                Road. When the sun sets, the street transforms rapidly: mobile street bars pop up all over the place
                selling buckets of “deadly” cocktail concoctions while bars and clubs line the street from top to
                bottom. Liberal Thais flock to Khao San Road come nightfall searching for a “farang” (foreigner) partner
                and a taste of the Western world. Built in 1782 and once the home of the Thai King, the royal court and
                the administrative seat of government, Bangkok’s Grand Palace is the most glorified and world-renowned
                landmark in the capital. Here all you architectural and culture junkies can lose yourselves in the
                ancient designs of the diverse array of Buddhist sculptures and temples that flow through the vicinity.
                Most popular amongst tourists has to be Wat Phra Kaew, in English the “Temple of the Emerald Buddha”.
                The 14th century Emerald Buddha, revered by all Thais, is a highlight too.
